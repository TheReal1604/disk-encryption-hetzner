These are clean step-by-step guides on how to setup a hetzner root server from their server auctions called "serverb√∂rse" to get fully-encrypted and remotely unlockable servers with or without different RAID-Systems and with or without LVM.

These guides *could* work at any other provider with a rescue system or with manually installed servers with little modifications.
